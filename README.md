<!-- BAVIN'S README - FORGED IN BARE METAL -->

> I am the engineer who worked 11.5-hour days in a car service center and came home to wage a second war against datasheets and hardware registers. Now, I am a Computer Engineering student with a single-minded focus: to become a world-class embedded systems engineer. I am the man who is tired but never stops.

## 🛡️ My Engineering Philosophy

My approach is built on a simple but powerful belief: **True mastery comes from the bottom up.**

*   **Bare Metal is the Foundation:** Before using an API, I need to know how to build it. I don't just call a function; I understand the registers, the interrupts, the DMA channels, and the timing that make it work. The datasheet is my most trusted tool.
*   **Understand *Why*, Not Just *How*:** I don't stop when the code works. I stop when I can explain precisely *why* it works, from the C code down to the electrons flowing through the silicon.
*   **Build Systems, Not Just Code:** I combine peripherals, protocols, and power management to create complete, robust, and efficient embedded systems—from RC cars to real-time ECUs.

## 🗺️ The Campaign Roadmap

My journey is a series of deliberate campaigns to conquer the world of embedded systems.

### ✅ **Phase I: The 8-Bit War [COMPLETED]**
- **Objective:** Total, bare-metal mastery of the ATmega328P (AVR) architecture.
- **Victories:** Built drivers from scratch for GPIO, Timers, Interrupts, PWM, ADC, UART, WDT, and Sleep Modes.
- **Result:** A portfolio of 100% bare-metal projects, including an RC car and traffic control systems.

### ✅ **Phase II: The 32-Bit Campaign [DEPLOYED]**
- **Objective:** Conquer the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture using the STM32F446RE.
- **Victories:** 
  - Migrated from 8-bit to 32-bit architecture.
  - Wrote custom drivers for **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**, **NVIC**, and **Hardware PWM**.
  - Implemented non-blocking UART communication using DMA Streams.
  - **Project:** STM32 ECU Simulation with FreeRTOS integration.

### 🔭 **Phase III: The System Architect [CURRENT]**
- **Objective:** Ascend to full-stack embedded development.
- **Targets:**
  - 🧠 Master Real-Time Operating Systems (FreeRTOS) internals.
  - 🐧 Tackle Embedded Linux.
  - 🔌 Design and manufacture multi-layer PCBs.
